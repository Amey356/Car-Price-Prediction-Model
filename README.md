# Car Price Prediction Model üöóüí∞

## Overview
This project builds a Car Price Prediction Model using different regression algorithms to estimate the price of a car based on various factors. The goal is to help buyers, sellers, and car dealerships understand car price trends and make informed decisions.

## The algorithms used in this project include:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net (Regularization Techniques)
  - KNN Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - XGBoost Regression

## Project Workflow üöÄ
1. Data Preprocessing
  - Handling missing values to ensure data completeness.
  - Encoding categorical features like car brand, fuel type, and transmission.
  - Normalizing numerical features for better model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Understanding price trends based on features like mileage, engine size, age, and fuel type.
  - Visualizing relationships between different variables to identify key patterns.

3. Feature Engineering
  - Selecting the most important features that influence car prices.
  - Creating new features (e.g., age of the car) to improve predictions.

4. Model Implementation
  - Training and testing different regression models.
  - Comparing performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score.

5. Model Optimization
  - Using regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) to reduce overfitting.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for better model accuracy.

## Results & Key Insights üîç
  - Polynomial Regression captures complex price patterns effectively.
  - Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net improve model generalization.
  - Tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) perform well in capturing non-linear relationships.
  - KNN Regression provides the highest accuracy, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.
